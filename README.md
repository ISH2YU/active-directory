An obsidian vault that consists of things related to Active Directory. Right now it is full of my CRTP notes. I will also add how to setup an environment soon.

In your newly created Obsidian Vault, install these Community Plugins

![setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/273da5a0-9c9e-4564-ace8-ac2aa3f682b9)

In the command palette, choose Git: clone, and enter the link of this repository. You will be prompted to select a directory, simply enter the name of your new directory. All the files in this repository will be cloned into your new directory. Restart Obsidian after cloning has completed, so that all files are successfully indexed.
