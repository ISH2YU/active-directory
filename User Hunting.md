```powershell title:"Find all machines on the current domain where the current user has local admin access"
Find-LocalAdminAccess -Verbose
```

This function queries the DC of the current or provided domain for a list of computers (`Get-NetComputer`) and then use multi-threaded `Invoke-CheckLocalAdminAccess` on each machine.

This can also be done with the help of remote administration tools like WMI and PowerShell remoting. Pretty useful in cases ports (RPC and SMB) used by `Find-LocalAdminAccess` are blocked. See `Find-WMILocalAdminAccess.ps1` and `Find-PSRemotingLocalAdminAccess.ps1`

```powershell title:"Find computers where a domain admin (or specified user/group) has sessions:"
1. Find-DomainUserLocation -Verbose
2. Find-DomainUserLocation -UserGroupIdentity "RDPUsers"
```

This function queries the DC of the current or provided domain for members of the given group (Domain Admins by default) using `Get-DomainGroupMember`, gets a list of computers (`Get-DomainComputer`) and list sessions and logged on users (`Get-NetSession/Get-NetLoggedon`) from each machine.

*Note that Server 2019 onwards, local administrator privileges are required to list sessions.*

```powershell title:"Find computers where a domain admin session is available and current user has admin access (uses Test-AdminAccess)"
Find-DomainUserLocation -CheckAccess
```

```powershell title:"Find computers (File Servers and Distributed File servers) where a domain admin session is available."
Find-DomainUserLocation -Stealth
```

```powershell title:"List sessions on remote machines (Not PowerView)"
Invoke-SessionHunter -FailSafe
```

*Above command doesn't need admin access on remote machines. Uses Remote Registry and queries HKEY_USERS hive.*

```powershell title:"Opsec friendly command (Not PowerView)"
Invoke-SessionHunter -NoPortScan -Targets C:\Path\To\servers.txt
```
